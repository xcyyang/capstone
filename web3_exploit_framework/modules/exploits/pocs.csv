akutar_nft	20220423	On Apr-23-2022, AkuDreams was hacked and loses more than 34M USD. There exist two serious logic vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability can cause a DoS attack due to the missing check if the bidder is a contract. As a result, the attacker can call the revert() and stop the honest bidders from getting back their bid amount. The Second will make the project fund being locked forever due to incorrect check in the require statment.	NFT,ERC721	ETH	Incorrect validation	DoS	incorrect validation and External calls can fail deliberately
anch	20220809	On Aug-09-2022, ANCH was attacked by skim token balance. The reason is that it supports skim() but the token transfer does not check if recipient and sender are the same.	ERC20,Reward	BSC	Insufficient validation	Flashloan	Insufficient validation, get rewards over skim()
annexfinance	20221119	On Nov-18-2022, AnnexFinance's liquidator contracts was attacked. The lost is a small amount ($3,000). The root cause is that the contract does not verify caller and pass in parameters in pancakeCall() functions. It could let attacker transfer the estuary tokens to attacker controlled panswap contract.	DEX	BSC	CWE-20	Flashloan	Lack of input validation
apecoin	20220517	On Mar-17-2022, the APE token has been attacked by the MEVor with loss $1.1 million. Someone discovered a way to claim the airdrop by using NFTs that they did not own at the time. They used the special way the airdrop works to carry it out. It was a very effective approach, earning them $1.1 million in ApeCoin. In particular, the attacker can borrow BAYC tokens that can be redeemed to NFTs, and then use these NFTs to claim the AirDrop. After that, the attacker mint the BAYC tokens using the BAYC NFTs to return the flash loan. The vulnerability is that the AirDrop process of the APE token only considers the spot state, which can be manipulated by the attacker.	ERC20	ETH	Business logic issue	Flashloan	Incorrect airdrop calculation
atk	20221012	On Oct-12-2022, ATK on BSC was attacked, the hackers abused Flashloan to attack the reward distribution function.	ERC20	BSC	CWE-682,Business logic issue	Flashloan,Price manipulation	Incorrect price calculation via balanceOf

Yield	ETH	Arbitrary call,CWE-20	Abuse approvals	Arbitrary call via write(), `exchangeData` is controllable and without any input validation
audius	20220723	"On Jul-23-2022, the Audius governance, staking, and delegation contracts on Ethereum mainnet were compromised due to a bug in the contract initialization code that allowed repeated invocations of the initialize functions. The bug allowed an attacker to maliciously transfer 18MM $AUDIO tokens held by the Audius governance contract (referred to as the ""community treasury"") to a wallet of their control and modify dynamics of the voting system to illicitly change their staked $AUDIO amounts in the network."	ERC20,Governance	ETH	Storage collision	Malicious proposal	Storage Collision & Malicious Proposal
aur	20221122	On Nov-22-2022, a suspicious tx gained over 49BNB (~$13K) from AURofficial_ pancakeswap AUR/WBNB pool. Due to the lack of permission check on the function call changeRewardPerNode(), attacker could change that value to a huge number which will be used to calculate node rewards.	ERC20	BSC	CWE-284,CWE-732		Lack of permission check on the function call changeRewardPerNode()
babyswap	20221001	"On Oct-01-2022, the BabySwap was attacked. The root cause is that the ""factory"" parameter of the router can be faked. Thus a fake swap can earn the BABY rewards token."	DEX	BSC	Insufficient validation		Insufficient validation on the parameter
bacon_protocol	20220305	On Mar-05-2022, the Bacon Protocol was hacked w/ ~$1M loss. The hack is made possible due to a reentrancy bug in the lend() routine so that the hacker can get more lending credits via re-entering the lend() routine.	Lending,ERC777	ETH	Reentrancy,CWE-841		Reentrancy in lend()
badguysbyrpf	20220902	"On Jan-17-2022, Bad Guys project was hacked. The exploit was due to the missing check for ""chosenAmount"" in the WhiteListMint function which allowed the attacker to pass the number of NFTs he/she wanted to mint."	NFT	ETH	Insufficient validation,CWE-20		"Missing check for ""chosenAmount"" in the WhiteListMint function"
bdex	20221105	On Nov-04-2022, Bvaults was under a price manipulation attack. The attacker gained 16 $WBNB. The root cause is the convertDustToEarned function of the BvaultsStrategy contract does not do price checks. Also, small trading pairs are sensitive to price fluctuations in swapping volume.	DEX	BSC	CWE-20	Price manipulation	the convertDustToEarned function of the BvaultsStrategy contract does not do price checks
beanstalk_farms	20220416	On Apr-17-2022, the BeanstalkFarms was exploited, leading to the gain of $80+M for the hacker (The protocol loss may be larger), including 24,830 ETH and 36M BEAN. The hack is made possible due to the flashloan-assisted (immediate) pass of BIP18. The BIP18 leads to the crafted code execution with the governance privilege to drain the pool fund.	Stablecoin,DAO	ETH	Insufficient validation,CWE-20	Flashloan,Malicious proposal	Insufficient validation
bego	20221020	On Oct-20-2022, this Tx (0x9f4ef3cc55b016ea6b867807a09f80d1b2e36f6cd6fccfaf0182f46060332c57) minted 1,000,000,000,000 $BEGO token, and then swapped to 12 WBNB, which started the drop of the $BEGO price on pancake swap. The main reason is the BGEO token's mint() is fundamentally flawed and allows for unlimited mints!	Metaverse,ERC20	BSC	CWE-305		Attacker can input empty data into _r, _s and _v to bypass all checks to mint BEGO token.
brachtopg	20221109	On Nov-09-2022, the brahTOPG project on the ETH chain was attacked, leading to the loss of $89,879. The root cause of this attack is that the Zapper contract is rigorously checking for incoming user data, leading to an arbitrary external call issue. The attackers exploit this vulnerability to steal funds from users who are still authorized to the contract.	Vault	ETH	CWE-470,Arbitrary call,Insufficient validation	Abuse approvals	Insufficient validation, leading to an arbitrary external call issue
build_finance	20220214	On Feb-14-2022, the Build Finance DAO has been the target of a hostile governance takeover in which a malicious actor has put forward and succeeded with a proposal to take control of the Build token contract, and the loss is $470k. The attacker succeeded in the takeover by having a large enough vote in favour of the proposal and there were not enough countervotes to prevent the takeover from happening.

gym_network	20220608	On Jun-08-2022, the GymSinglePool of GymNet is hacked w/ the loss of $2.1m (~7.5K BNB). The bug is due to the lack of caller verification, which is exploited to increase the balance without making any payment.	ERC20	BSC	Incorrect access control,CWE-284		Incorrect access control
hackdao	20220524	On May-24-2022, The Hackerdao token on BSC has been attacked. The attack is due to incorrect handling of the Uniswap V2 pair logic in the token contract. In the _transfer function, the total amount of the transfer will first be reduced from the sender's account. Then if the recipient address is the designated Uniswap pair (BSCUSD-Hackerdao pair), an extra amount of fee will be further reduced from the sender. It results in a typical pattern of token attacks, if the balance of the Uniswap pair can be reduced without any swap (i.e. a difference between accounted reserves and real token balances), there is an opportunity of price manipulation. The attack is done by skimming from the WBNB-Hackerdao pair to the BSCUSD-Hackerdao pair, causing an imbalanced price.	DAO	BSC	CWE-684,Business logic issue	Flashloan,Price manipulation	Incorrect logic in _transfer function of token contract

rari_capital_fei_protocol	20220430	On Apr-30-2022, Various Rari Fuse polls of Fei protocol was exploited and the total loss is ~$80 million. The root cause of this attack stems from a Reentrancy security loophole where an attacker is able to borrow assets yet withdraw all the deposited collateral. Specifically, the attacker flashloaned multiple tokens/WETH as collateral and borrowed assets from the pool. However, as the code implementation does not apply the practice of the check-effect-interaction pattern, the result means that the attacker can invoke “exitMarket()” to withdraw all his collateral as the borrow records are not properly updated.	Lending	ETH	Reentrancy	Flashloan	Not follow check-effect-interaction pattern
reaper_farm	20220801	On Aug-01-2022, Reaper Farm was hacked for ~$1.7M.
