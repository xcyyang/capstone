  description: On Feb-06-2022, Meter was hacked and the loss is $4.3 million. This project used an unaffiliated fork of ChainBridge and introduced a new function depositEth() which has a vulnerability. The hacker can send an arbitrary amount in the calldata, which gets passed on the handler's deposit.
