  description: On Nov-04-2022, Bvaults was under a price manipulation attack. The
    attacker gained 16 $WBNB. The root cause is the convertDustToEarned function of
    the BvaultsStrategy contract does not do price checks. Also, small trading pairs
    are sensitive to price fluctuations in swapping volume.
