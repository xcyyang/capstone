  description: On Nov-18-2022, AnnexFinance's liquidator contracts was attacked. The
    lost is a small amount ($3,000). The root cause is that the contract does not
    verify caller and pass in parameters in pancakeCall() functions. It could let
    attacker transfer the estuary tokens to attacker controlled panswap contract.
